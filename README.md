=================================


Problem 1
=========
Write a function that adds up all of the positive integers not divisible by 2 or 3 below 1000

Problem 2
=========
Suppose you work in a US supermarket and you need to make change for x cents using the fewest number of coins.
Write a function that takes an Integer x representing the monetary value of the change that needs to be made, and will return a list representing the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies to return as change.

Problem 4
=========
Write a function that takes a list of integers, and returns a list of all palindrome numbers that can be written as a product of any two (possibly the same) numbers in that list. For example, the result of "palindromeProducts [10..30]" should be
[121,242,252,272,464,323,414,494,525,484,616,575,696,676]

Problem 6
=========
Suppose you work in a supermarket in Popland and you need to make change for x cents using the fewest number of coins. Write a function that takes a list of positive Integers representing Poplandâ€™s coin denominations, and an Integer x representing the monetary value of the change that needs to be made. You may assume that the coin denominations are all positive integers in decreasing order, and that the last one is 1 to ensure that there is a solution for every x.
